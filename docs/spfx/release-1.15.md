## New features and capabilities

### Form Customizer Extension

The Form Customizer Extension allows developers to customize new, edit and display forms of the lists and document libraries. 

> [!NOTE]
> The API to apply form customizers to a content type or list is still work in progress. 
> Developers can use local debugging and direct link to `SPListForm.aspx` page to test the customizers.
> Please, check `config\serve.json` file created during the provisioning for more details.
> You can see live demo of this process from following YouTube video - [Preview on upcoming list extensibility options with SPFx v1.15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90DWB9hjo-k).

### Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK v3 Support

The **MSGraphClientFactory** allows a developer to select the version of the Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK to use.

> [!NOTE]
> Default behavior is to use v1 of the Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK for backward compatibility.

```typescript
this.context.msGraphClientFactory.getClient('3');
```

### Updated Command Set Extension Template

The template was updated to use `listViewStateChanged` event instead of deprecated `onListViewUpdated` event.

## Deprecations

- Deprecated SPComponentLoader#getManifests due to runtime performance overhead.
